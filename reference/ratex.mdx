<Accordion title="What is this protocol about?">
  **RateX** is a margin and spot yield trading protocol operating across multiple chains, providing yield tokenization, as well as yield and principal splitting and trading.

  On **RateX**, users can trade Yield Tokens (YT) of various yield-bearing assets (YBA) with leverage, benefiting from yield movements in a capital-efficient way.

  Besides leveraged yield trading, **RateX** provides two integrated features, Earn Fixed Yield and Yield Liquidity Farming, to meet various user needs.
