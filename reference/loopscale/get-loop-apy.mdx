<Note>
  ### Note

  - Both the borrow and base APY are sourced real-time from Loopscale.
  - You may obtain the Loop ID (`loop_id`) from the [/loopscale/loop/markets](/reference/loopscale/get-loop-markets) endpoint.
  - Use `include_mint_addrs=true` to include mint addresses in the `include` object of the response.
  - No API key is required by default, with higher rate limits for requests using an API key. Get your free API key from [our team](https://eesuhn.github.io/eesuhn/).
