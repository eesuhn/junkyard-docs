<Accordion title="What is this protocol about?">
  **Loopscale** is a modular, order book-based lending protocol on Solana. It enables overcollateralized borrowing and lending across a wide range of digital assets, including staked tokens, liquidity provider positions, and more specialized primitives.

  By replacing pooled liquidity and algorithmic rates with direct order book matching and non-algorithmic, market-based rates, **Loopscale** improves capital efficiency, enables more precise risk management, and supports new types of markets that are difficult to achieve with traditional DeFi architectures.
